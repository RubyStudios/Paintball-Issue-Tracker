# Paintball Tracker
Issue tracker for ["Project: Paintball"](http://www.roblox.com/games/240402056/Project-Paintball).

## Tracker Guidelines
For Bugs:
When you post a new issue you must put a way to replicate the bug, otherwise we will mark it as invalid and move on. We will re-open it once you add a way to replicate the bug.

For Suggestions:
Tell us what should be implemented, and if possible how to implement.

### Notes
We are still refining the Guidelines for Paintball.
